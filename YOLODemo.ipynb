    "# A Demonstration of Object Detection Using the YOLOv8 Object Detection Model\n",
    "### Anthony Gorman\n",
    "Object Detection has been in the forefront of computer science research since artificial intelligence emerged in the 1960's. With recent developments in open-source computer vision models, understanding and deploying object detection is easier than ever. In this demonstration, we will attempt to deploy the state-of-the-art object detection model You Only Look Once (YOLO) version 8 from Ultralytics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "Before we begin deploying YOLO (or any object detection model for that matter), it is important that we consider creating a virtual environment. A virtual environment is a special container for python modules that protects the user from dependency errors. In this tutorial, we will use Miniconda. The documentation for installing Miniconda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#installing). This tutorial will assume that you are utilizing Miniconda in a Unix terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Miniconda is installed, you can create a python environment for YOLO by running the following command in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda create --name yolo```\n",
    "\n",
    "then you can enter into the environment by running\n",
    "\n",
    "```conda activate yolo```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to reopen this notebook in the environent. The method of doing this will depend on the software you are using for Jupyter Notebooks. For [reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-virtual-environments-jupyter-notebook-bb5820d11da8). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can install the necessary prerequisites for YOLOv8 by running the box below"
